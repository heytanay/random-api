## Status API is an API that does the Hard Part of Checking your Web app's Status for you!

This API is built only using Node Built-in modules, no external frameworks or APIs involved. Not a single one.

# Note for Developers: If you are doing a PR, please do all changes in the 'staging' branch not on the master one.

# API is still under development and will be completed soon!
